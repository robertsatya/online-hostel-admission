#What is  it ?
--------------
This is a Online based Interactive Hostel Admission system targeted at students of NIT Surat.

Because the current manual system requires the student to be present at the center and it is extremely tiresome to stand in the queue for 6-7 hours
Also this interface provides a interface to view your hostel plan and select your room live

#Description
------------
The project aims at providing an online portal for the hostel admission process that goes on every year in SVNIT. 
Now with the proposal of every student enrolled in a full-time course in the college to stay at hostel the crowd and 
incovinience during hostel admission is just gonna increase. 

So with this situtation in mind, the concept of taking the whole system online has been developed. 
Students get to login to their accounts and choose a hostel a per the guidelines set by college and select a room of their choice. 
All of this is done with the help of an interactive interface that'll allow students to select their room 
without any incovinience of standing several hours in line during admissions.
